3. Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
4. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code. 
5. After cloning, open the index.html file in VS Code and run it with Live Server to view the Landing page.

This setup will allow you to test the TaskFlow backend API endpoints either using Postman or by setting up a simple frontend with Live Server. Ensure the backend server is running and accessible at http://localhost:8080 before proceeding with these options.
